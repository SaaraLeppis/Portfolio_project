# PORTFOLIO project

This was school project to learn HTML5 and CSS3
When I started this project I knew that there is header, ul and li elements, but not much more. It has been long journey to get the project as it is now. I have learned a lot and amazed of all the possibilities we can do with CSS.

Some photos from Unsplash and Pexels (see in Credits below) and some are my own.
Many ideas and knowledges collected from many, many internet pages.

I learned to make the ReadMe-file only at the end of project, so unfortunately all Credits can't be given, as I can't remember all sites visited.
Next time I will do better!
